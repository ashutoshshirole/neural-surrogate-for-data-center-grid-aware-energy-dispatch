# neural-surrogate-for-data-center-grid-aware-energy-dispatch
This project develops supervised neural surrogate models to learn the DC-OPF economic dispatch operator for 24-hour flexible data center scheduling. Trained on CVXPY-GUROBI solutions of the IEEE-14 system, the models achieve 450–700× faster inference with &lt;0.2% cost deviation, enabling real-time grid-constrained dispatch emulation.
